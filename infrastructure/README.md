# infrastructure/ — Lab 1 Part B Terraform skeleton

Skeleton for Task B1. **It is empty on purpose**: every file declares its
variables and outputs, and `main.tf` lists the resources you owe, but no
resources are written for you.

Verify it starts clean before you add anything:

```bash
cd environments/dev
terraform init
terraform fmt -check -recursive ../..   # no output = pass
terraform validate                      # exits 0
```

Both must still pass when you submit — that is 5 of the 15 points in B1.

## Layout

```
modules/vpc/        aws_vpc, aws_subnet (public only), aws_internet_gateway,
                    aws_route_table, aws_route_table_association, aws_security_group
modules/storage/    aws_s3_bucket + public_access_block, versioning,
                    server_side_encryption_configuration, aws_s3_object x4
modules/iam/        one aws_iam_role (MLEngineer trust), one aws_iam_policy,
                    one aws_iam_role_policy_attachment
modules/sagemaker/  aws_sagemaker_domain, aws_sagemaker_user_profile
```

Each module contains **only** its designated resources — that is graded.

## The rule that catches people

**No hardcoded names.** The rubric runs:

```bash
grep -rn '"northstar-dev"' infrastructure/modules/
```

and expects nothing. Build names from `var.project` and `var.environment`
(`"${var.project}-${var.environment}-data"`), and give every variable a
`description` — that is also graded.
